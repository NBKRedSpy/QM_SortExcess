# Quasimorph SortExcess

![thumbnail icon](media/thumbnail.png)

Scrolling through multiple pages of the same item just to find the 3rd item in the list?

This mod changes the sort so that each item type will have a maximum of eight slots filled at the top of inventory screen, and then the rest will be put at the bottom.

The number of slots can be configured.  See the [Configuration section](#configuration).
