[h1]Quasimorph SortExcess[/h1]


Scrolling through multiple pages of the same item just to find the 3rd item in the list?

This mod changes the sort to put a maximum of 8 items at the top of the list and the remainder of the items at the bottom of the list.
The amount can be changed in the configuration.

After using the items at the top of the list, run the sort to bring more of that item back to the top.
